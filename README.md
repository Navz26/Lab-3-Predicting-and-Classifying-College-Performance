Lab 3 – Predicting and Classifying College Performance


1)  Objective
This lab applies Linear Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to understand the difference between predicting continuous values and classifying categorical outcomes using real-world datasets.


2) Datasets
College.csv – U.S. college statistics (applications, enrollment, graduation rate, private/public)
Smarket.csv – Stock market data used to replicate regression and classification tasks


3)  Tasks Completed
1. Regression: Graduation Rate Prediction
Used Linear Regression to predict Grad.Rate
Features include applications, enrollment, tuition, and undergraduate population
2. Classification: Private vs Public Colleges
Used KNN Classification to predict whether a college is Private or Public
3. Final Exercise (From Scratch – Smarket Dataset)


4)  Linear Regression to predict Today
KNN Classification to predict Direction (Up/Down)
Evaluated models using MSE and accuracy
Compared results across both datasets


5)  Key Takeaways
Regression models predict numeric outcomes
Classification models predict categories
Dataset characteristics strongly impact model performance


6)  Tools Used
Python
pandas
scikit-learn


7)  Course
